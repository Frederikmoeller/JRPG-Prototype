# JRPG-Prototype
The Idea for my project is a turn based JRPG in the vain of Octopath Traveler and the old Final Fantasy games. The game should allow me to attack an enemy and have that enemy fight back. It should also include an overworld that the player runs around in until running into combat. The player should also of course be able to die or escape the fight. The UI should display the visible player characters health and be understandable for the player.
